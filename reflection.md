Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
    In the Cafe subclass:
        The constructor, one has nFloors in the parameters and the other doesn't have one, it defaults to one. 
        The sellCoffee, one has nSugarPackets and cream the doesn't so these ingredients are optional 
    In the Libray subclass:
        removeTitle() and addTitle(), I overloaded them so that they accept either a single title or a list of them. 
    In the House subclass:
        moveOut() and moveIn(), I overloaded them so that they accept either a single student or a list of students. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Overall, most of the inheritance functionalities worked well. To anyone taking this course in the future, I’d recommend taking full advantage of OOP inheritance to write shorter, cleaner, and more organized code.
